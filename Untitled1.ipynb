This error often indicates an issue with the input data being passed to the model, such as incorrect tensor shapes, data types, or invalid indices (e.g., out-of-bounds token IDs or segment IDs). Since the error occurs during the embedding layer calculation (`embeddings = inputs_embeds + token_type_embeddings`), it's highly likely related to the `input_ids` or `token_type_ids`. The most common cause for this in the context of fine-tuning a BERT-based model is an issue with the `token_type_ids`.\n",

        "The BioBERT model (`dmis-lab/biobert-base-cased-v1.1`) is a standard BERT model which expects `token_type_ids` (also known as segment IDs) to distinguish between different segments in the input (e.g., [CLS] Sentence A [SEP] Sentence B [SEP]). However, in the previous data preparation step, we simply tokenized the single text entries from Wikipedia and the specialized datasets and assigned a dummy label. We did not explicitly generate or handle `token_type_ids` for a two-segment input, and the `tokenizer`'s `encode` or `__call__` method with `add_special_tokens=True` typically generates `token_type_ids` for a single segment (all zeros). The error \"device-side assert triggered\" suggests that the model might be expecting `token_type_ids` with values other than 0 or 1, or that the dimensions are somehow mismatched.\n",
        "\n",
        "To fix this, we need to explicitly ensure that the `token_type_ids` are correctly generated and included in the dataset. The `tokenizer`'s `__call__` method handles this when `return_tensors='pt'` and `padding='max_length'` are used, as it automatically generates `input_ids`, `attention_mask`, and `token_type_ids`. However, the previous tokenization step used `tokenizer.encode` and manually handled truncation. The `map` function on the `datasets.Dataset` will apply the tokenization function to batches, and using the tokenizer's `__call__` method with `padding` and `truncation` is the standard and recommended way to prepare data for Hugging Face models.\n",
        "\n",
        "I will modify the tokenization function to use `tokenizer.__call__` which will return all necessary components (`input_ids`, `attention_mask`, `token_type_ids`). I will also ensure the combined dataset is correctly formatted for PyTorch tensors before passing it to the Trainer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, the previous traceback shows a `SyntaxWarning` related to escape sequences in the notebookapp.py file. While this is not directly related to my code's error, it's good practice to be aware of such warnings. The `wandb` logging prompt also appeared, indicating that Weights & Biases logging is enabled by default in the `Trainer`. While useful for tracking experiments, it's not strictly necessary for completing this subtask and can add noise or require user interaction. I will add `report_to=\"none\"` to the `TrainingArguments` to disable this logging for now.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, I will keep the corrected `eval_strategy` and `save_strategy` arguments in the `TrainingArguments`.\n",
